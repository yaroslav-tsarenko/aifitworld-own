      {/* Refund principles */}
      <Card>
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-3">4. Refund principles (binding rules)</h2>
        <div className="space-y-3 opacity-90 text-sm">
          <p><strong>4.1 Refund cap.</strong> Any refund will not exceed the amount you originally paid for the Tokens/Service (net of any non-refundable processor fees) in the currency of purchase.</p>
          <p><strong>4.2 No refund for Spent Tokens.</strong> Tokens that have been redeemed are non-refundable, except where:</p>
          <div className="ml-4 space-y-1">
            <p><strong>(a)</strong> the digital Service supplied is materially defective or materially not as described;</p>
            <p><strong>(b)</strong> we failed to supply the Service as contracted; or</p>
            <p><strong>(c)</strong> a refund is required by law.</p>
          </div>
          <p><strong>4.3 Unused Tokens.</strong> Unused Tokens are generally refundable at the original purchase price if you request a refund before Tokens are spent. We may deduct non-refundable payment processor fees; any deduction will be itemised in the confirmation.</p>
          <p><strong>4.4 Account-binding; non-transferable.</strong> Tokens are tied to the Account they were credited to and cannot be transferred or assigned.</p>
          <p><strong>4.5 No cash-out.</strong> Tokens cannot be exchanged for cash or other real currency, except where required by law.</p>
          <p><strong>4.6 Promotional/bonus Tokens.</strong> Promotional/bonus Tokens are non-refundable unless the specific offer states otherwise (e.g., guaranteed-refund trials).</p>
          <p><strong>4.7 Immediate supply & opened content.</strong> Where you consent to immediate supply of digital content and then access or download it (e.g., a Training Plan PDF), you acknowledge that your 14-day cooling-off right may not apply to that transaction. Refunds in such cases are available only under 4.2 or as legally required.</p>
          <p><strong>4.8 Bespoke/custom work.</strong> For custom materials, refunds are unavailable once substantial work has begun, unless otherwise stated in a written bespoke agreement. Where staged delivery is agreed, any refund (if applicable) may be pro-rated per the bespoke terms.</p>
          <p><strong>4.9 System/technical errors.</strong> If a technical issue on our side prevented delivery or corrupted a file, we will re-deliver, repair, replace, or refund as appropriate.</p>

          <p><strong>6.1 Evidence.</strong> For redeemed Services we may review order and Token logs, checkout confirmations (Token baseline/conversion shown at checkout, totals), access/delivery logs (download timestamps, export IDs), and any evidence you supply.</p>
          <p><strong>6.2 Method.</strong> Approved refunds are usually sent to the original payment method. If unavailable, we may offer a reasonable alternative (e.g., bank transfer) subject to verification.</p>

We may refuse refunds and suspend or close Accounts where there is fraud, abuse, or repeated unwarranted chargebacks.
